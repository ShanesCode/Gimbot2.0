# Gimbot2.0
Developed in Spring 2020, allows users to create events, rsvp to them, and see a calendar of upcoming events month by month (as well as the next upcoming events).

Full list of commands and how to use them are at the bottom of this readme.

Events are created with the ?event-add command.

The tag is used to ping users with the same role, and the event is displayed in the #events channel.

Users can manually see the next 3 upcoming events with the ?event-upcoming command.

Users can sign up to events and join the list of attendees with the ?event-attending command, followed by the ID of the event (displayed on the event post). Events can be deleted in a similar manner: ?event-remove ID.

Upcoming events can be viewed in an ASCII calendar, by using the ?calendar command.
